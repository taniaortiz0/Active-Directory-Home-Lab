![Windows Server 2022](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/686d0760-915e-4029-ac08-00b2123c08e6)

I configured Windows Server 2022 as my Domain Controller (DC) and this will be utilized as the Default Gateway for the two NICs. 



![2 NICs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a35df314-692a-4bb9-a6d1-5613e4cd8209)

I Included two Network Adapters, one is to attach to NAT (Internet) and other one is to the Internal Network (Isolated).  I then configured the Internal Network to set up the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS.



![AD DS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/383fb88e-41bb-492d-9bc7-858e74cab26b)

Next, I Installed AD DS (Active Directory Domain Services) and created a domain.

I went to the Local Server to see my Domain being listed on the Properties section. 



![domain admin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a71c432-4ba4-45d4-9e9f-0faabf9398b8)

I went ahead and got into the Windows Administrative Tools then into Active Directory Users and Computers to create a domain admin account.

Next, I installed and configured RAS (Remote Access Server) with NAT (Network Address Translation). This will be utilized for the Windows 11 client to be in a private-virtual network, but still be able to access the Internet through the DC. 



![DHCP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdbd4e46-b9fc-4c6c-876e-7ec53647f126)

Next, I installed DHCP Server for the Windows 11 client to get an IP address which will give it access to the Internet meanwhile, it's in a private-internal network.



I downloaded a custom powershell script and a text file (names of users) to create (+1000) users for the AD Lab. I edited the powershell script to implement password security.

![powershell ise 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae80e8bd-e1d7-4423-87c7-be2459d8ca98)

I utilize the command Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted to be able to run PowerShell scripts that are downloaded from the Internet. I then switched directories and executed the PowerShell script.



![POWERSHELL Script generated +1000 users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5874c100-28a7-4914-ae5f-8e8a483e3cea)

As we see, the custom PowerShell script created (+1000) users for the AD Lab.



![wINDOWS 11 BYPASS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b033512-7ae2-4385-b736-94c734cf3556)

For Windows 11 to be in a private-internal network, it needs to be bypassed through the network settings and act as an Internal NIC. The Client is going to obtain the IP address from the DHCP Server I've configured.



![DHCP route](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a062e52-203d-4efd-876a-8a51b6166681)


As the Client doesn't have a default gateway I included a Router through the DHCP Server Options and a loopback address.


![Address Leases](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3454249e-eda7-4285-bdcf-26bb02cd582b)


I then configured my Windows 11 Client for it to be a member of mydomain.com. We can verify this through the Address Leases on my Domain Controller.


![cmd whoami](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc4a3936-67c9-47a8-bc72-8302b3a7cca9)


Finally, I logged in to my Client through the domain, MYDOMAIN and verified I am in.
